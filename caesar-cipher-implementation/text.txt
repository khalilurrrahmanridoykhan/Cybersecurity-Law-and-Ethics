Into:
Each character is substiuted by a letter certain fixed number position it's later or before the alphabate.
Example: A is replaced by two positions down D. D would become F and so on.

Algorithm:
    1. This Technique is quite simple to apply encryption
    2. Each text is replaced by the fixed number of position down or up with the alphabate.
    3. It is a simple type of substitute cipher.

There is an integer value replaced to define each latter of the text that has been moved down. This integer value is also as the shift.

Cipher(n) = De-cipher(26-n)

Encription(X) = (x + n)mod 26
Decryption(X) = (x + n)mod 26
